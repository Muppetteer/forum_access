This module changes your forum administration page to let you apply role-based
permissions to each forum, and to give each forum individual moderators.

Moderators automatically get all privileges on all posts in that forum,
including edit and delete. The theme_forum_access_moderator_list() function 
is available for theming a list of moderators.
